        Hello! I'm Sai Kumar Bachireddy, a dedicated and detail-oriented Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Backend, and full-stack development. I recently completed my Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Florida, where I focused on building scalable systems, cloud-native applications, and Machine learning applications.
        <br /><br />
        My professional experience spans both academic and industry settings. At the National Science Foundation (NSF), I contributed to AI integration platforms and data infrastructure projects, helping build resilient, serverless architectures for research-grade applications. Prior to that, I worked at Fronesis Solutions, where I developed backend services for EdTech platforms using Spring Boot, and implemented scalable microservices and API-driven solutions that enhanced system performance and maintainability.
        <br /><br />
        My technical toolkit includes languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, and technologies such as React, Node.js, AWS, Docker, and Apache Kafka. I'm deeply passionate about solving real-world problems through innovative, cloud-first solutions and data-driven insights.
        <br /><br />
        Outside of work, I enjoy exploring emerging tech trends, working on personal projects, and continuously sharpening my problem-solving skills. I'm always open to collaborating on impactful tech initiatives or discussing the latest in cloud and data engineering.
        <br /><br />
        Let’s connect and build something great together!
